# Last.fm-Data-Retriever-and-Preprocessor
A program in Python that connects to the API of Last.fm, a site that tracks users' music listening history, and retrieves JSON data of a user's plays. The retrieved data is then preprocessed into a CSV file that is formatted for bar chart races, highlighting the progression of a user's most-played artists throughout their time on Last.fm.
